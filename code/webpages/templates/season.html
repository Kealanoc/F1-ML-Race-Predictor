            <h2>Tale of the season</h2>
            <p>The 2020 season was simultaneously one of the most entertaining but predictable seasons in Formula 1. The season originally planned to have 22 races, the most in a single F1 season and was due to begin in Melbourne, the annual season opener. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic that gripped the world, the season start wouldnt begin until to July. Despite being a shortened season and some tracks being forced to host multiple races, there was no loss of drama or of spectacular entertainment.</p>
            <p>The season eventaully kicked off in Austria to empty stands, but the lack of fans didn't affect the amazing display of racing we saw here. In total, nine drivers retired in the first round and Bottas won the first race of the season for the second consecutive year. The on track action was intense throughout the race which culminated in reigning champion Lewis Hamilton hitting the rear of Alex Albon's car as he was attempting to defend from an overtake. Without Alex's crash, the win was predicted to be his for the taking. This led to Hamilton receiving a time penalty, which gave a storming Lando Norris an oppertunity to finish less than five seconds behind Hamilton and secure his first Formula 1 podium. He set the fastest lap of the race on the last lap and joined the podium alongside Bottas and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc.</p>
            <p>The second race held in Austria, the Styrian GP, was won by Hamilton but had a very strong showing from the midfield and yet more last lap drama. The following race was held in Hungary saw Verstappen lose his car on the wet and cold surface and hit the wall on his reconaissance lap before the race had even begun. His engineers however, did an incredible job to get the suspension fixed in time for the beginning of the race. A great demonstration of the skill and talent of F1 engineers and mechanics. The British GP followed, and although recently having become a place of Hamilton dominance, the script was a bit different this year. Daniil Kvyat had a puncture at very high speed slamming into the wall hard. This was followed by a number of near end of race tyre failures. Carlos Sainz's tyre blew up while he was on for a fourth place finish, Bottas suffered a puncture which made him finish eleventh and Hamilton suffered a tyre delamination and puncture but still found his way across the line in first. </p>
